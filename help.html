    <P>CLAIMING YOUR BUSINESS
        It is important for you to claim your business listing. Claiming your business means that you are the rightful owner or have the authority from the owner to manage the business page. To do so, simply click “claim now” on the business page and provide your information. We will verify anyone that submits a claim to ensure only the rightful person can claim a business that is listed with us. A claimed business will appear with a check mark next to the name.
